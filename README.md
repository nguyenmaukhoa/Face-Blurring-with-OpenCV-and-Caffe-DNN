# Face-Blurring-with-OpenCV-and-Caffe-DNN
Perform face blurring in the an image with OpenCV and Caffe DNN Model

## Overview
In today's world, cameras and videos are everywhere and privacy has become a big concern, so much so that manual identification and annotation to preserve privacy are often not practical. In this application notebook we will demonstrate how to automatically identify faces in images using a deep learning model and then obfuscate them using various techniques to preserve privacy by obscuring the identity of the people in the images. This notebook will demonstrate various techniques using images, but this can easily be extended to videos based on the prior modules that covered video analysis. In this notebook we will use standard blurring, pixelation, and also incorporate the use of an elliptical mask to provide a better approximation to blurring the shape of a person's face.
